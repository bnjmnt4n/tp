### Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic): Parses and executes the appropriate command according to the user's input.
* [**`Model`**](#model): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component <a name="ui"></a>

The `UI` component interacts with other components of SociaLite, and uses the JavaFX UI framework to render a GUI.

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/ui/Ui.java).

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts, including `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All the parts, as well as the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.  The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

The `PersonCard` part also has a reference to the `MainWindow` to provide improved user feedback via the main window after user interactions which do not execute a command using `Logic`.

### Logic component <a name="logic"></a>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

![Logic Class Diagram](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SocialiteParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

![Parser Class Diagram](images/ParserClasses.png)

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `SocialiteParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `SocialiteParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component <a name="model"></a>
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="500" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the contact list data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component <a name="storage"></a>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="950" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save contact list data, user preference data and command history data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `ContactListStorage`, `UserPrefsStorage`, `CommandHistoryStorage` and `ProfilePictureStorage` which means it can be treated as any one (if the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes <a name="common"></a>

Classes used by multiple components are in the `socialite.commons` package. These include:

* [`core`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/socialite/commons/core): General classes which deal with storage of SociaLite configuration and GUI settings, logging and commonly used messages. The [`Index`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/commons/core/index/Index.java) class is also used widely to manage references to specific items in the contact list.
* [`exceptions`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/socialite/commons/exceptions): Common exceptions used throughout SociaLite.
* [`util`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/socialite/commons/util): Utility methods pertaining to collections, files, JSON, strings, etc.

## **Implementation** <a name="implementation"></a>

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Help Command <a name="help_command"></a>

In order to simplify the error messages displayed via the GUI whenever a user enters an invalid command or non-conforming command format, 
the display of in-app guidance and help messages has been abstracted away from the specific command. As a result, the existing `HelpCommand` was 
revamped and expanded to display in-app guidance, consisting of the following details for a specified command:
* Overview of specified command's function
* Acceptable format of user input
* Example of using the specified command

Represented below is the sequence diagram when `help XYZ` is executed. For illustration purposes, `XYZ` refers to an acceptable command in SociaLite that has in-app guidance for users' reference.

![HelpSequenceDiagram](images/HelpSequenceDiagram.png)

For the correct `HelpCommand` to be created and appropriate in-app guidance to be displayed, a `HelpCommandParser` was created to parse additional keywords provided by the user. 
The acceptable keywords are: `add` `delete` `edit` `find` `picture` `pin` `unpin` `remark` and `share`.

Should an invalid keyword accompany `help`, the `HelpCommandParser` will create a generic `HelpCommand` that displays the HelpWindow dialog box. 
The HelpWindow dialog box provides users with the link to our User Guide and the list of acceptable keywords (as listed above) to view in-app guidance.


### Find Command <a name="find_command"></a>
The Find command allows users to find a contact in their list by keywords.
A contact's name, tags and/or social media platforms can be specified as keywords. 

Command takes inputs of the form `find KEYWORDS`, where `KEYWORDS` can include multiple spaced user inputs,
prefixed with `t/` for tags, `p/` for social media platforms or no prefix for names.

Find Command will update the person list under Model package, based on which contacts match the keywords,
and return a CommandResult which tells how many contacts matched in the search.

Should `KEYWORDS` be improperly formatted or empty, a generic CommandResult with an error message will be given and Model will not be updated.

Below is the sequence diagram for an execution of `find KEYWORDS`, assuming `KEYWORDS` are a valid query string

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Picture Command <a name="picture_command"></a>

The Picture command allows users to add a profile picture to their contacts. The user can enter the command `picture INDEX` which would open a file browser to let the user choose any .jpg or .png file to be used as the profile picture, provided `INDEX` is a valid index.

Represented below is the sequence diagram when `picture INDEX` is executed. For illustration purposes, `INDEX` refers to any valid index starting from 1 to the number of contacts in the displayed list.

![PictureSequenceDiagram](images/PictureSequenceDiagram.png)

Note that the picture command depends on the MainWindow in the UI package as it retrieves the file from a file chooser.

### Command History <a name="command_history"></a>

Command history allows users to navigate through commands that they have entered previously by pressing `UP/DOWN` key in the command box. It resembles the behavior of a macOS or Windows terminal. As a result, users can simply make slight edits to the previous command to rectify a typo.

Command history from all previous sessions will be stored in `commandhistory.json`, and loaded as a list of strings in `CommandHistory` class when SociaLite is launched. The command history of the current session will be added to the list of strings, and written back to the `.json` file upon exiting SociaLite.

If the `.json` file is non-existent or faulty, or if SociaLite encounters any problem reading the `.json` file , it will start with an empty command history.

Represented below is the sequence diagram on how command history is saved when any command is executed. For illustration purposes, `CMD` refers to any command (valid or invalid) that the user types in the command box, `XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name.

## **Appendix: Requirements** <a name="requirements"></a>

### Product scope <a name="scope"></a>

**Target user profile**:

* avid social media user
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* needs to manage a significant number of contacts
* wants to catch up with their contactsâ€™ activities quickly 
* wants to connect with their followers/friends on various social media platforms through an all-in-one dashboard

**Value proposition**: 

Our product serves as an integrated dashboard for a user to retrieve the social media handles and account information of his/her contacts. This makes it seamless for the user to interact with his/her contacts instead of having to access each social media account that the contact owns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The instructions and test cases under this section only provide the general aspects of the SociaLite app for testers to work on. If you happen to be a tester, please feel free to explore around using your own test cases!
</div>

### Launching and exiting the app

Download the latest `jar` file from SociaLite [release page](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/releases), and copy it into an empty folder that you have access to read and write.

1. Launching
   
   1. Double-click on the `jar` file icon in your OS' GUI
   
      Expected: the GUI for SociaLite app shows up with a set of sample contacts.
   
   2. Locate the directory using your terminal and enter `java -jar socialite.jar`.
   
      Expected: ditto.
   
2. Exiting

	While SociaLite is running:

	1. Click on the `X` button on the window (top-left for macOS, top-right for Windows).

		Expected: the Socialite app quits normally.

	2. While SociaLite is running, type `exit` in the command box of the GUI and hit `Enter`.

		Expected: ditto.


### Adding a contact

While SociaLite is running, try out the following test cases in sequence:

1. Enter `add n/aa p/12345678` in the command box.

	Expected: A new contact card with name "aa" and phone number "12345678" is created. This contact card will likely appear at the top, as SociaLite displays records in alphabetical order of contacts' names.

2. Enter `add n/ab p/12345678` in the command box.

	Expected: SociaLite shows error message "A contact with the same phone number already exists in the contact list!".

3. Enter `add n/aa` in the command box.

	Expected: SociaLite shows error message, indicating invalid command format given. This is because name and phone fields are compulsory for the addition of contact.

4. Enter `add n/aa p/87654321` in the command box.

	Expected: A new contact card with name "aa" and phone number "87654321" is created. SociaLite allows names to be repeated in the contact list as it uniquely identifies contacts through their phone number.

5. Enter `add n/John Appleseed p/13572468 fb/john.appleseed twitter/morethanfifteenchars`.

	Expected: SociaLite shows error message, indicating that the Twitter handle does not follow their naming convention.

### Editing a contact

Assuming you have performed all preceding test cases in order, you should have 10 contacts stored in SociaLite, with the contact card "aa" appearing at the top of the list.

1. Enter `edit 1 n/abc` in the command box.

    Expected: the first contact card's name changes to "abc". After this modification, this contact card might no longer be the first in the list due to alphabetical ordering

2. Enter `edit 100 n/abc` in the command box.

    Expected: SociaLite shows error message, indicating invalid person index provided.

3. Enter `edit 2` in the command box.

    Expected: SociaLite shows error message, indicating at least one field to edit must be provided.

4. Enter `edit 1 fb/hello` in the command box.

    Expected: the first contact card in SociaLite should now display a Facebook icon at the bottom, with the handle "hello".

5. Enter `edit 1 t/tag1 t/tag2 t/tag3 t/tag4` followed by `edit 1 t/` in the command box.

    Expected: the first contact card in SociaLite will be shown to have four tags, and all four tags will disappear upon entering the second command.

### Deleting a contact

Assuming there are 10 contacts stored in SociaLite:

1. Enter `delete 1` in the command box.

	Expected: the first contact card in SociaLite will be deleted. There will be 9 contacts left in SociaLite.

2. Enter `delete 100` in the command box.

	Expected: SociaLite shows error message, indicating invalid person index provided.

3. Enter `delete 0` in the command box.

	Expected: SociaLite shows error message, indicating index must be non-zero unsigned integer.

### Finding a contact

Assuming there is a contact called "Aaron Tan" in SociaLite:

1. Enter `find aaron tan` in the command box.

	Expected: only contact cards with the name "aaron tan" (case-insensitive) will show up in the list.

2. Enter `find a t` in the command box.

	Expected: all contacts whose name contain two or more words, with any of the word starting with "a" and another starting with "t" (e.g. Aaron Tan, Alice Teo, Tony Ang, Terry Au) will show up in the list.

3. Enter `find at` in the command box.

	Expected: the contact card "aaron tan" will **NOT** show up in the list.

4. Enter `find p/telegram` in the command box.

	Expected: all contact cards with Telegram handles will show up in the contact list.

5. Enter `find p/instagram p/tiktok` in the command box.

	Expected: all contact cards with both Instagram and TikTok handles will show up in the contact list.

6. Enter `find p/linkedin` in the command box.

	Expected: SociaLite shows error message, indicating invalid platform specified.

7. Enter `find t/tag1` in the command box.

	Expected: all contact cards with "tag1" will show up, which includes the first contact from the earlier test case.

8. Enter `find t/` in the command box.

	Expected: Socialite shows error message, indicating tags to search for must not be empty.

### Accessing social media page

To test out this feature, you can choose to add your own contact information to SociaLite with your own social media handle. For example, you can enter `add n/<your name> p/<your phone number> ig/<your instagram handle>`.

1. Hover your cursor over your Instagram handle in SociaLite.

	Expected: the handle will turn underlined and the cursor will turn into a hand.

2. Click your mouse when it is hovering over a certain handle.

	Expected: SociaLite will open your default web browser and launch your chosen social media page (e.g. your own Instagram profile).

### Adding a profile picture to a contact

Assuming there are 10 contacts stored in SociaLite:

1. Enter `picture 1` in the command box.

	Expected: a file chooser will show up for you to select your profile picture.

2. Click on `cancel` button or press `Esc` button in your OS.

	Expected: you will be redirected to the SociaLite app, with error message indicating command aborted.

3. Locate a `.jpg` or `.png` file of your liking and select it in the file chooser.

	Expected: the first contact card's profile picture will update to be the file that you have chosen.

4. Enter `picture 100` in the command box.

	Expected: SociaLite shows error message, indicating invalid person index provided.

### Pinning/Unpinning a contact

Assuming there are 10 contacts stored in SociaLite and none of them are pinned, try out the following test cases in sequence:

1. Enter `pin 3` in the command box.

    Expected: the third contact card in the list will be brought forward to the top of the list. The button "Pin" will change colour and its text will become "Unpin".

2. Enter `unpin 1` in the command box.

    Expected: the first contact card in the list (previously the third in the list) will be removed from the top of the list and return to its original position (i.e. in alphabetical order of names). The button "Unpin" will return to its original colour and its text will display "Pin".

4. Enter `unpin 1` one more time in the command box.

    Expected: SociaLite shows error message, indicating that the person is not pinned yet.

5. Enter `pin 2` followed by `pin 1` in the command box.

    Expected: Socialite shows error message, indicating that the person has already been pinned.

6. Enter `pin 100` in the command box.

    Expected: SociaLite shows error message, indicating invalid person index provided.

7. Navigate to the sixth contact card in the GUI and click on the "Pin" button with your mouse.

    Expected: The sixth contact card in the list will be pinned to the top of the list. The button "Pin" will change colour and its text will become "Unpin".

8. Click on the "Unpin" button of the first contact card in the list with your mouse.

    Expected: same as test case number 2. The chosen contact card will be unpinned and return to its original position in the list (i.e. in alphabetical order of names). The button "Unpin" will return to its original colour and its text will display "Pin".

### Sharing a contact

Assuming there are 10 contacts stored in SociaLite:

1. Enter `share 1` in the command box.

	Expected: SociaLite shows that the contact information has been copied to the clipboard. You may also try to paste it to text editor or Word document to verify the information.

2. Navigate to the fifth contact card in the GUI and click on the "Share" button with your mouse.

	Expected: Socialite shows that the contact information of the fifth contact has been copied to the system clipboard. The "Share" button will change its text to "Copied!" for two seconds, before reverting to "Share".

3. Enter `share 100` in the command box.

	Expected: SociaLite shows error message, indicating invalid person index provided.


### Dealing with data

You can find the data files for SociaLite in the `data/` directory. You may wish to try out the following test cases in parallel:

1. Before launching SociaLite, delete `contactlist.json`.

	Expected: Socialite will start with a set of sample contacts. Upon closing, a new `contactlist.json` file is created with the sample contacts.

2. With SociaLite running, delete `contactlist.json`.

	Expected: SociaLite functions as per normal. Upon closing, the correct `.json` file will be created by SociaLite under the same directory.

3. Before launching SociaLite, open `contactlist.json` and type in some random characters to make it an invalid `.json` file.

	Expected: SociaLite will start with an empty contact list. SociaLite still functions as per normal.  Upon closing, a new `contactlist.json` file is created with the sample contacts. If you are using terminal to open the `jar` file, you will see a log message indicating that SociaLite will start with an empty contact list.
